My name is Ira Levin.  I'm a full-stack developer living in Camarillo, CA.  I like Microsoft .NET and C#, but I *love* Ruby and Ruby on Rails.  Here's a more or less complete list of the technologies I'm currently into:

* Languages: C#, Ruby, Javascript
* Web Frameworks: ASP.NET (including Web Forms and MVC) and Ruby on Rails
* Mobile Frameworks: PhoneGap/Cordova and Ionic
* HTML
* CSS
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* Angular JS
