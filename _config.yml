  This blog contains tasty bytes of information I've accumulated over the years
  as it relates to Web application development.  The plan is to cover whatever
  seems relevant or useful to other developers.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://ilevin350.com" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
